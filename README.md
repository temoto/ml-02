====

A toy project plant condition classificator.


Roadmap
=======

* (done) Get images, e.g. leafsnap-dataset
* Label images
* Setup prepare (resize/encode/etc) pipeline
* Setup train pipeline (program classifier)
* Labeling utility

MVP: pretrained network tells if plant on particular picture needs more water/nutrients/light or not.
